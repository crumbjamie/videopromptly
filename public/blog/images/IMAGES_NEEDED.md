# ChatGPT Image Generation Prompts for Blog

## Instructions for ChatGPT

When generating these images, please:
- Use original-image.jpg as the base image for transformations
- Create clean images without any text overlays
- Do not add backgrounds unless specified
- Output as a grid or individual images only
- Focus on visual content without labels or captions
- Generate images at 1200x630px for main images (items 1-4)
- Generate images at 400x300px for thumbnails (item 5)
- Output will be in PNG format - convert to JPG after download if needed

## 1. Complete Guide Hero Image

Generate a 2x3 grid showing different AI transformation styles of original-image.jpg. Include the original in the top-left position, then show transformations: anime style, oil painting, cyberpunk aesthetic, minimalist line art, and 3D animation style. Keep each panel clean without text.

## 2. Portrait Transformation Examples  

Create a visual showing portrait transformations of original-image.jpg. Display the original alongside various artistic styles including anime, Renaissance painting, cyberpunk, and watercolor effects. Present as a clean grid layout.

## 3. ChatGPT vs Midjourney Comparison

Generate a side-by-side visual comparison using original-image.jpg. Transform it in two different styles to show rendering differences - one cleaner/accurate style (left) and one more artistic/cinematic style (right). No text or labels needed.

## 4. Troubleshooting Guide Visual

Create abstract visual representations of common issues: file size (large vs small icon), content policy (shield icon), rate limits (clock/hourglass), and quality (pixelated vs sharp). Use simple, modern iconography without text.

## 5. Blog Thumbnail Images

Create individual transformations of original-image.jpg suitable for blog post previews:
- Transform to vibrant anime style for the complete guide
- Transform to elegant portrait style for the portrait prompts post  
- Create a split style transformation for the comparison post
- Transform to a technical/digital style for the troubleshooting post

**Remember:** Output only the images themselves - no text overlays, no backgrounds unless part of the artistic style, and no labels or captions within the generated images.
