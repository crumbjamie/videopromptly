Running into errors with ChatGPT image generation? You're not alone. Here are solutions to the most common issues users face, along with tips to avoid them in the future.

## Common Errors and Solutions

### 1. "I can't generate images of people"

**Error Message:** "I can't identify people in images or create images of real people."

**Solution:**
- Use generic descriptions instead of names
- Focus on style rather than identity
- Describe characteristics without naming individuals
- Use terms like "person," "subject," or "individual"

**Example Fix:**
- ❌ "Transform this into Elon Musk style"
- ✅ "Transform this into a tech entrepreneur style with confident expression"

### 2. "Content Policy Violation"

**Error Message:** "This request may violate our content policy."

**Common Triggers:**
- Celebrity names
- Brand logos
- Potentially sensitive content
- Copyrighted characters

**Solutions:**
- Rephrase using generic terms
- Focus on style elements rather than specific IPs
- Avoid brand names and logos
- Use descriptive language instead

### 3. "I'm unable to process this image"

**Possible Causes:**
- File size too large (over 20MB)
- Unsupported format
- Corrupted file
- Network issues

**Solutions:**
- Compress images before uploading
- Use JPEG or PNG formats
- Check file integrity
- Try uploading again
- Clear browser cache

### 4. Rate Limit Errors

**Error Message:** "You've reached your image generation limit."

**What's Happening:**
- DALL-E 3 has hourly limits
- Approximately 50 images per 3 hours

**Solutions:**
- Wait for limit reset
- Plan generations efficiently
- Save all outputs
- Use variations wisely
- Consider upgrading plan if needed

### 5. Poor Quality Results

**Common Issues:**
- Blurry images
- Wrong style applied
- Lost subject identity
- Incorrect colors

**Solutions:**

**For Blurry Images:**
- Add "high quality," "sharp," "detailed"
- Specify "4K" or "HD"
- Avoid overly complex prompts

**For Wrong Style:**
- Be more specific about style
- Reference known artists or movements
- Use multiple style descriptors

**For Lost Identity:**
- Add "while maintaining likeness"
- Use "preserve facial features"
- Include "keep the same person"

### 6. Text Rendering Issues

**Problem:** Text appears garbled or incorrect

**Solutions:**
- Put text in quotes: "Generate image with text 'HELLO'"
- Specify font style
- Keep text short
- Use simple fonts
- Check spelling in prompt

### 7. Aspect Ratio Problems

**Issue:** Images are always square

**Current Limitations:**

- Limited aspect ratio options

**Workarounds:**
- Specify "wide landscape format"
- Use "vertical portrait orientation"
- Request "cinematic widescreen"
- Crop afterward if needed

### 8. Consistency Issues

**Problem:** Can't maintain consistent style across images

**Solutions:**
- Save successful prompts

- Be extremely specific

## Optimization Tips

### For Better Results:

1. **Structure Your Prompts**
   ```

   ```

2. **Use Power Words**

   - "High-quality"
   - "Detailed"
   - "Masterpiece"
   - "Award-winning"

3. **Avoid Ambiguity**
   - Be specific about colors
   - Define lighting clearly
   - Specify backgrounds
   - Clarify compositions

### Prompt Templates That Work

**For Portraits:**
```
"Transform this portrait into [style], maintaining facial features and expression, with [lighting type] lighting and [background description]"
```

**For Artistic Styles:**
```
"Apply [artist/movement] style to this image, emphasizing [key characteristics], while preserving the subject's identity"
```

```
"Place the subject in [environment], with [time of day] lighting, maintaining original pose and proportions"
```
