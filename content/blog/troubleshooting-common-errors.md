Running into errors with ChatGPT image generation? You're not alone. Here are solutions to the most common issues users face, along with tips to avoid them in the future.

## Common errors and solutions

**Error Message:** "I can't identify people in images or create images of real people."

**Solution:**

- Describe characteristics without naming individuals
- Use terms like "person," "subject," or "individual"

**Example Fix:**

### 2. "Content Policy Violation"

**Error Message:** "This request may violate our content policy."

**Common triggers:**
- Celebrity names
- Brand logos
- Potentially sensitive content
- Copyrighted characters

**Solutions:**
- Rephrase using generic terms
- Focus on style elements rather than specific IPs

- Use descriptive language instead

### 3. "I'm unable to process this image"

**Possible causes:**

- Unsupported format
- Corrupted file

**Solutions:**
- Compress images before uploading

- Try uploading again
- Clear browser cache

### 4. Rate limit errors

**Error Message:** "You've reached your image generation limit."

### 5. Poor quality results

**Common issues:**

- Incorrect colors

**Solutions:**

**For blurry images:**

- Use multiple style descriptors

**For lost identity:**

### 6. Text rendering issues

**Problem:** Text appears garbled or incorrect

**Solutions:**
- Put text in quotes: "Generate image with text 'HELLO'"
- Specify font style
- Keep text short

- Check spelling in prompt

### 7. Aspect ratio problems

**Issue:** Images are always square

**Workarounds:**

## Optimization tips

### For better results:

   ```

   - "Masterpiece"
   - "Award-winning"

3. **Avoid ambiguity**

   - Specify backgrounds
   - Clarify compositions

### Prompt templates that work

**For portraits:**
```
"Transform this portrait into [style], maintaining facial features and expression, with [lighting type] lighting and [background description]"
```

**For artistic styles:**
```
"Apply [artist/movement] style to this image, emphasizing [key characteristics], while preserving the subject's identity"
```
