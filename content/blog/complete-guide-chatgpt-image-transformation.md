## 1. Introduction to AI Image Transformation {#introduction}

AI image transformation has revolutionized how we edit and create visual content. With ChatGPT's integration of DALL-E 3, anyone can transform ordinary photos into extraordinary works of art using simple text prompts.

### Maintaining Subject Identity

To keep the subject recognizable while applying dramatic transformations:

- Use phrases like "while maintaining facial features"
- Specify "keep the same pose and expression"
- Add "preserve the original composition"

### Environmental Changes

Transform not just the subject but their entire environment:

> "Place the subject in a futuristic Mars colony with dome structures and red landscape"

## 5. Best Practices {#best-practices}

- Save successful prompts

### ❌ Don'ts

- Avoid vague descriptions
- Don't use copyrighted characters

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues {#troubleshooting}

### Issue: Image looks nothing like the original

**Solution:** Add "maintain the original subject's features" or "keep the same person/object" to your prompt.

**Solution:** Ensure your image doesn't contain sensitive content. Try rephrasing your prompt to be more appropriate.
