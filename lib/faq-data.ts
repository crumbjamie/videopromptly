    answer: "Simply browse our collection, find a prompt you like, click the 'Copy' button, then open ChatGPT. Upload your image and paste the prompt. ChatGPT will transform your image based on the prompt instructions. You need ChatGPT Plus for image generation capabilities."

    question: "Do I need a paid ChatGPT subscription?",
    answer: "Yes, you need ChatGPT Plus (or Team/Enterprise) to use DALL-E image generation features. The subscription costs $20/month and includes access to GPT-4 and DALL-E image creation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use these prompts with other AI tools?",
    answer: "While our prompts are optimized for ChatGPT with DALL-E, many can be adapted for use with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Leonardo AI, and other AI image generators. You may need to adjust the syntax slightly for different platforms."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of transformations can I create?",
    answer: "Our prompts cover a wide range of transformations including: toy and action figure conversions, artistic styles (oil painting, watercolor, anime), professional portraits, fashion photography, cyberpunk aesthetics, vintage effects, 3D renderings, and much more across 40+ categories."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the generated images free to use?",
    answer: "Images generated through ChatGPT are subject to OpenAI's usage policies. Generally, you own the rights to images you create, but you should review OpenAI's current terms of service for commercial usage guidelines."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get the best results?",
    answer: "For best results: 1) Use high-quality source images, 2) Choose prompts that match your image type, 3) Replace [subject] with specific descriptions, 4) Experiment with tweaking prompts, 5) Try multiple prompts for different effects."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I modify the prompts?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Our prompts are templates. Feel free to modify them by adding specific details, changing styles, adjusting colors, or combining elements from different prompts to create unique results."
  },
  {
    question: "What does [subject] mean in the prompts?",
    answer: "The [subject] placeholder should be replaced with a description of what's in your image. For example, if transforming a photo of yourself, replace [subject] with 'person' or a more specific description like 'woman with brown hair' or 'man in business suit'."
  },
  {
    question: "How often are new prompts added?",

  },
  {
    question: "Do the prompts work with any image?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do I share my transformed images?",
