  {
    question: "How do I use this video prompt?",
    answer: "Copy the prompt text and paste it into Veo3, Runway ML, Pika Labs, or your preferred AI video generation platform. Most prompts work best with 8-second duration settings."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I modify this prompt?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Feel free to customize any part of the prompt - change the subject, location, camera angle, or style to match your creative vision. The prompt is a starting template."
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms work with this prompt?",
    answer: "This prompt is optimized for Veo3 but works great with Runway ML, Pika Labs, Stable Video Diffusion, and most AI video generation tools. You may need to adjust technical settings for different platforms."
  },
  {
    question: "Why might my video look different?",
    answer: "AI video generation has natural variation. Each generation produces unique results even with identical prompts. Try generating multiple versions to get the best result."
  },
  {
    question: "What if the video doesn't match the prompt?",
    answer: "Try: 1) Regenerating with the same prompt, 2) Simplifying complex elements, 3) Breaking the prompt into shorter segments, or 4) Adjusting platform-specific settings like duration or aspect ratio."

  "ASMR & Satisfying": [
    {
      question: "What makes a good ASMR video prompt?",
      answer: "Effective ASMR prompts focus on close-up details, smooth movements, repetitive actions, and satisfying textures. Include specific materials, lighting conditions, and gentle motion descriptions."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I create satisfying content that goes viral?",
      answer: "Focus on transformation, symmetry, repetitive patterns, and unexpected reveals. Use prompts that create anticipation and payoff, like cutting, organizing, or revealing hidden elements."

  "Cinematic & Film": [
    {
      question: "How do I achieve cinematic quality in AI videos?",
      answer: "Use professional camera terminology (crane shot, dolly zoom, rack focus), specify lighting conditions (golden hour, dramatic shadows), and include film references or cinematography styles."
    },
    {
      question: "What camera movements work best for AI video?",
      answer: "Simple movements like slow pans, gentle zooms, and tracking shots tend to work better than complex camera work. Specify the movement clearly and keep it smooth."
    }

// General tips for video generation
export const videoGenerationTips = [
  {
    question: "How do I get better video quality?",
    answer: "Use detailed prompts, specify camera movements and lighting, choose appropriate aspect ratios, use higher-tier platform settings when available, and generate multiple versions to pick the best result."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the ideal video length for AI generation?",
    answer: "8 seconds is the current sweet spot for quality and consistency. Some platforms support longer durations, but shorter clips often have better quality and more predictable results."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I avoid common AI video artifacts?",
    answer: "Keep movements simple, avoid too many elements changing simultaneously, use clear subject descriptions, and specify consistent lighting throughout the scene."
